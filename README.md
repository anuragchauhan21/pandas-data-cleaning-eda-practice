# Pandas Data Cleaning & EDA Practice

![Preview](pandas.png)

This repository contains my hands-on practice with **Pandas**, focusing on key data preprocessing and analysis techniques. It follows a structured learning path through a YouTube playlist, covering real-world data handling scenarios.

### Topics Covered
- Reading data from CSV, Excel, and other formats
- Filtering, sorting, and indexing
- Grouping and aggregation
- Merging and joining DataFrames
- Data cleaning (nulls, duplicates, type conversion)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Dataset Source
The datasets used are part of a YouTube playlist series.  
To respect ownership rights, datasets are not included.
